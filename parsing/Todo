As a start :

[ ]: Doubly linked list with value and type in it (takes a token) tokens will be enum

[ ]: We store everything , white spaces also, each one in a string while assigning a type to each one.

[ ]: In the case of double quotes we treat everything as a string until we find the closing one, then we come back looking for any $ for expanding, if found we expand.

[ ]: For single quotes everything inside is literal.

[ ]: Pipe sign should have a previous and a next != NULL.

[ ]: Space after redirections can be skipped, it still a valid syntax.

[ ]: Any other special charachter is treated as literal. 

[ ]: The final result is a linked list of commands for execve. pipes are not stored in the linked list because more than one node means the existence of one or more pipes.

// COMMENT :
Til here the parsing is done.
