// FIXED $$ | $1 stops at the first digit |  no var found (should return key not NULL)
// FIXED "$PWD"'why this' this case doesnt handle single quote part properly


// [ ] heredoc expansion for quotes
// [ ] handle heredoc 
// [ ] since quotes should escape special characters, should i include a isascii condition ?

// FIXED "'$PWD'" segfaults and final result doesnt print anything, maybe i delete all the list at some poiint 
     // handle quotes is broken !     
// printf(">>> curr -%s- type: %d\n", curr->value, curr->type);

// [ ] handle redirections and open files (last in assign to infile and last out assign it to outfile for each command)
      // it should check syntax for valid filename (ex : case of expansion)


// FIXED handle args doesnt work in : ls -la no pipe
